		<h3> About Us </h3>

		<p> Kunqu stands as the oldest extant genre of Chinese theatre and has had far-reaching influences on Chinese literature, stage performance, music, and dance. In 2001, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) proclaimed kunqu, along with 18 other forms of cultural genres, as a masterpiece of â€œthe oral and intangible heritage of humanity. </p>

		<p>Founded in 1988 and incorporated in 1989, the Kunqu Society is a non-profit corporation with the mission of studying, preserving, and promoting kunqu.

		<p>Kunqu is a form of Chinese musical drama. But it is more than just drama: it is a combination of play, opera, ballet, poetry recital, and musical recital. It also draws on earlier forms of Chinese theatrical performances: mime, farce, acrobatics, ballad recital, and medley, some of which go back to the third century BC or even earlier. It is first and foremost a performing art: people come to see and hear a performance. The plot is usually familiar to the audience, or else made available through a prose summary. In the performance of Kunqu three media work simultaneously and in harmony: words, music and dance.
		</p>

		<p>The name Kunqu refers, strictly speaking, to the musical element of this art form, and is connected with the fact that one of the principal types of regional music that went into the making of Kunqu came from the district of Kunshan (near Suzhou, in modern Jiangsu Province). This type of regional music goes back to the fourteenth century. It was given shape in the sixteenth century by Wei Liangfu and other, who combined it with three other forms of southern music and with northern tunes from the drama of the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368). Wei Liangfu and his collaborators standardized the rules of rhyme, tones, pronunciation, and notation, making it possible for this regional form of music to become a national standard. By the end of the sixteenth century, Kunqu spread from the Suzhou region to the rest of China, and became the most prestigious form of Chinese drama. It has survived until the present, but from the late eighteenth century on it was crowded out by the less sophisticated and less complex Beijing opera.
		</p>

		<p>Chinese theatre-goers go to see a performance rather than a play. Therefore a theatrical program often consists not of a single play but of selected scenes from different plays. In fact, some of the classical plays are so long that a complete performance would take up many hours or even several days.
